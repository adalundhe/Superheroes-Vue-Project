BSCA Superheroes Vue Project
Sean Corbett
Summer Part-Time 2017 Class

This is my first full-stack Vue/Express/Mongoose application. To run our
database, whenever we restart or start our computer we *must* run:

  sudo mongod

then leaving the terminal/command prompt window in which we run the command
open. This project requires the following Node/npm packages:

  - ExpressJS
  - Body Parser
  - Mongoose

and can be installed via command:

  npm install --save express body-parser mongoose
